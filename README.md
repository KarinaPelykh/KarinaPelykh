# Hi everyone👋
I'm Junior Frontend Developer👩‍💻.A year ago, I started immersing myself in the world of programming. 
Now I can't live without it. From the very beginning, I felt as if a winged wind of words and thoughts lifted me up💫.
I am open to communication and exploring the vast world of programming. I am ready to create together with you✨.
